The goal of this program was to read the game status from the file, make a move and save it. 
Game was being generated by "game_generator.cpp". I also added example file with game status. 
Unfortunetly game has some mistakes and sometimes after few rounds programs crushes. That was my very first big program in 
CPP language and I've never found time to finish it properly.
